The provided Terraform code provisions an autoscale setting for an Azure App Service Plan. Let's break it down:

Provider Configuration:

Specifies the Azure provider with azurerm.
features {} block enables all available provider features.

Resource Group:

Creates an Azure resource group named "autoscale-example-resources" in the "West Europe" region.

App Service Plan:

Creates an Azure App Service Plan named "example-app-service-plan" in the same resource group and region as the resource group.

Defines the SKU (service tier and size) for the App Service Plan as "Standard" and "S1" respectively.

Autoscale Setting:

Creates an Azure Monitor Autoscale Setting named "example-autoscale-setting" in the same resource group and region as the resource group.

Associates the Autoscale Setting with the previously created App Service Plan using the target_resource_id attribute.

Defines a profile for autoscaling based on CPU usage.

Configures capacity settings with a default of 1 instance, a minimum of 1 instance, and a maximum of 3 instances.

Sets up two autoscale rules based on CPU usage metrics:

The first rule triggers an increase in the instance count if the CPU percentage exceeds 75% over a 5-minute period. 

It increases the instance count by 1 and has a cooldown of 1 minute.

The second rule triggers a decrease in the instance count if the CPU percentage falls below 25% over a 5-minute period. 

It decreases the instance count by 1 and has a cooldown of 1 minute.

This configuration sets up autoscaling for the App Service Plan based on CPU usage metrics. 

It ensures that the number of instances automatically scales up or down to meet the defined thresholds, helping to optimize resource utilization and handle varying workload demands.
