The provided code creates a basic network infrastructure in 
Microsoft Azure using Terraform. 


Here's what each section of the code does:

Provider Configuration:

Sets up the Azure provider using the azurerm plugin.
Specifies the Azure subscription ID from the var.subscription_id input variable.

Input Variables:

Declares input variables to accept values for Azure subscription ID, resource group name, resource group location, virtual network name, virtual network CIDR block, and network security group name.
Provides default values for some of the variables.

Resource Group:

Creates an Azure resource group using the azurerm_resource_group resource.
Uses the provided var.resource_group_name and var.resource_group_location for the resource group name and location, respectively.

Virtual Network:

Creates an Azure virtual network using the azurerm_virtual_network resource.
Uses the provided var.virtual_network_name, azurerm_resource_group.example.name, and azurerm_resource_group.example.location for the virtual network name, resource group name, and location, respectively.
Specifies the address space for the virtual network using the
var.virtual_network_cidr_block.

Subnet:

Creates an Azure subnet using the azurerm_subnet resource.
Sets the subnet name as "FollSubNet" and associates it with the virtual network and resource group using the corresponding attributes.
Specifies the address prefix for the subnet using ["10.0.1.0/24"].

Data Source:

Retrieves information about the created subnet using the azurerm_subnet.example resource.
Specifies the subnet name, virtual network name, and resource group name 
in the data "azurerm_subnet" "example" block.

Network Security Group:

Creates an Azure network security group using the azurerm_network_security_group resource.
Uses the provided var.network_security_group_name, azurerm_resource_group.example.location, and azurerm_resource_group.example.name for the network security group name, location, and resource group name, respectively.
Defines a security rule named "SSH" to allow inbound TCP traffic on port 22.

Subnet-Network Security Group Association:

Associates the created subnet with the network security group using the azurerm_subnet_network_security_group_association resource.
Specifies the subnet ID and network security group ID using 
azurerm_subnet.example.id and azurerm_network_security_group.example.id, 
respectively.

This code creates a resource group, virtual network, subnet, network security group, and associates the subnet with the network security group in Azure. 

It also fetches information about the subnet using a data source.
