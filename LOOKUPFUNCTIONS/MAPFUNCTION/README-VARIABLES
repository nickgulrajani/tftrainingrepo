The variables.tf file in Terraform is used to define input variables that can be used throughout your Terraform configuration. 


Here's what the code snippet does:

The variable block defines a variable named "environment" of type string.

It represents the environment for the resources you're provisioning. 


The description attribute provides a description or explanation of the variable, and the default attribute sets a default value of "dev" for the variable if no value is explicitly provided.

The variable block also defines a variable named "dns_servers" of type map(string).

 It represents a mapping of environment names to DNS server IP addresses. 

The default attribute provides a default mapping where "default" maps to "8.8.8.8", "dev" maps to "10.0.0.1", and "prod" maps to "10.1.0.1".

These variables allow you to customize and parameterize your Terraform configuration based on the specific environment you're working with. 

The "environment" variable allows you to specify the environment name, while the "dns_servers" variable allows you to provide environment-specific DNS server IP addresses.

By defining variables in variables.tf, you can easily manage and update configuration values without modifying the underlying code. 

It provides flexibility and reusability by allowing you to input different values for these variables depending on your specific use case or environment.
