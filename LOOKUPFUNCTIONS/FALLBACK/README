The variable block defines a variable named "config" of type map(string). 

It has a default value that is a map of key-value pairs.

The module block declares a module named "example_module". 

It specifies the source of the module as "./example_module", indicating that the module is defined in a directory relative to the current configuration.

Within the module declaration, the config_value argument is set using the lookup function.

The lookup function retrieves the value associated with the key "key4" from the var.config map. 


If the key is not found, it returns the fallback value "default-value".

The output block defines an output named "config_value". 

It retrieves the value of module.example_module.config_value and makes it available as 
an output value.

The purpose of this code is to showcase how the lookup function can be used to retrieve values
from a map variable with a fallback mechanism. In this example,
the lookup function is used to fetch the value associated with the key "key4" from the var.config map. If the key is present, the associated value is used. If the key is not found, the fallback value "default-value" is used instead.

The value of this approach is that it provides a way to handle situations where certain 

configuration values may be missing or not provided, ensuring that the code does not fail and 
has a default value to fall back on. It adds flexibility and resilience to the configuration 
by allowing defaults or fallback values to be used when specific values are not available.
